# Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and
#1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is
#between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
#print a grade using the following table:
#Score Grade
#>= 0.9 A
#>= 0.8 B
#>= 0.7 C
#>= 0.6 D
#< 0.6 F
#Use try/catch expection handling to gracefullly exit not non-numeric user input.


import sys
print("This program will calculate a letter grade based on the student's score.")

# Prompt user for the score
inp = input('Enter score: ')

# Convert this input to float, because the input statement accepts user input as a string by default.
# Wrap this within a try-except code block to exit gracefully as the conversion to float will fail if the user supplied a non-numeric input!
try:
    score = float(inp)
except:
    score = -1
    print ("Score must be an integer. Please try again. Goodbye.")
    sys.exit()

#Use conditional loop to to determine grade on user supplied input.

if score > 1.0 or score < 0.0:
    print('Bad score')
elif score > 0.9:
    print('The grade is A!')
elif score > 0.8:
    print('The grade is B!')
elif score > 0.7:
    print('The grade is C!')
elif score > 0.6:
    print('The grade is D!')
else:
    print('The grade is F!')
